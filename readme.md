# Visualizing the prime fractions 

## Notation and background

For example, the fraction of $\frac{1}{7}$ can be expressed as repeated decimals(base 10) as  $$\frac{1}{7}=0.\overline{142857}$$ . We can generalize this for arbitrary fraction (a, b, n), which denotes $\frac{a}{b} \mathrm{mod} n $. The intention of webapp here is just to visualize the pattern for generic prime fractions with arbitrary base number, just for fun.
